# Project-Python-Foundations-FoodHub-Data-Analysis
For this project, I helped a mock food aggregator company make sense of their customer order data. The company had stored thousands of transactions from their online portal, and they wanted to extract actionable insights to drive smarter business decisions.

I tackled key questions around customer behavior, order trends, and operational efficiency to turn raw data into strategic recommendations that could directly improve the business. This project sharpened my skills in data wrangling, exploratory analysis, and insight communication.
